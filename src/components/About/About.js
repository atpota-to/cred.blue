        <p>
          Unlike social media scores that have predated it, cred.blue is <strong>not</strong> a measurement of social influence or popularity. Instead, it aims to measure an accountâ€™s general reputation or footprint within the Atmosphere community, regardless of how many followers it has.
        </p>
        <p>
        The cred.blue score is not set in stone. It will evolve in tandem with the AT Protocol and Atmosphere.
